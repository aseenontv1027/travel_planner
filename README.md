# Bettr Trip - Read Me

If you're planning a trip then look no further. Bettr Trip allows you to search and save locations for your trip, and organizes everything into an adjustable itinerary. Plus, it gives you important details such as routes between destinations, recommended locations to visit, and weather forecasts. Trip planning has never been easier with Bettr Trip!

## Installation

In one terminal, run `bundle` to install the dependencies. Run `bin/rake db:setup` to create the databases (called rails_project_development by default). Run `bin/rails s` to run the server.

In the other terminal, `cd` into `client`. Run `npm install`. Then run `npm start` and go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.
